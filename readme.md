You want to run gum.py

gio.py is a set of functions that support gum.py and is necessary to run it. Don't delete that. (Why would you)

Legacydef.py is an old input parsing function that we kept for version control

pipe.py is a standalone python testing file for splitting strings at instances of a character that is NOT escaped (ie | instead of \| because \| could go in regex somewhere)

subcommand.py is a standalone python testing file for parsing nested parentheses and running contents to substitute with string
